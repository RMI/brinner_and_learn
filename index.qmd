This page hosts all slides for presentations given during SPD's Brinner and Learn series.

Each chapter title to the left is a link to a slide deck.

-   These slides are being developed *by the SPD team*.
-   Each deck will open in its own tab.
-   You may want to type "s" at the start of each deck to open the *s*peaker notes.
-   Some of these slides may end up being adopted as a more formal SPD [practice](https://rmi.github.io/practices).
