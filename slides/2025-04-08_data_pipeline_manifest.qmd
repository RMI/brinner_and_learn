# What is a Data Pipeline Manifest?

- I looked for good examples, standards, recommendations...
  - I didn't find any! ðŸ˜‚
- There are many other uses of manifest (or similar) files in other programming contexts:
  1. web extensions
  2. chrome extensions
  3. package.json in NPM (JS) packages
- Typically, they define all the things needed to build something.

---

# So, what is a Data Pipeline Manifest to me?

- Like a build manifest, but somewhat in reverse
  - everything I would need to know to re-build the same exact dataset
- born out of a need to explain or verify specific data points in datasets I had created

---

# Reproducability is key to fixing/understanding things

- very common in software development / bug fixing
- same goes for data, if you can't do it you can't explain it

---

# How does a manifest file help?

- helps answers questions to guide your investigation
  - is the data unmodified?
  - is everything there?
  - what were the input files?
  - what was used to build it?
  - what happened in the black box?

---

	a. Filenames
	b. Directory structure
- do the files contain what is expected?
