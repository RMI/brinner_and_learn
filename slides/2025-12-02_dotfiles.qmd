## What are dotfiles?

- Configuration files that live in your `$HOME` directory
- Usually start with a dot (so they’re “hidden”):
  - `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`
  - `.gitconfig`
  - `.config/ghostty/config`
- They control how your tools behave:
  - shell prompt, aliases, colors
  - git defaults, editor settings, etc.

## Why care about dotfiles?

::: incremental
- New machine? → “Why doesn’t anything feel right?”
- Dotfiles in a repo give you:
  - **reproducible setups**
  - **easy sharing** of configuration (new laptop, new team member)
  - a place to **grow** your personal setup over time

## Dotfiles as a developer’s fingerprint

- Everyone’s environment is a bit different:
  - preferred shell, editor, prompt, tools
- Your dotfiles encode:
  - how you navigate
  - how you debug
  - how you use git, ssh, etc.
- Putting them in a repo:
  - documents how *you* work
  - lets you borrow good ideas from others 😄

## The problem: dotfiles sprawl

- Config files live all over `$HOME`:
  - `~/.bashrc`
  - `~/.gitconfig`
  - `~/.config/ghostty/config`
- If you edit them in-place:
  - hard to sync between machines
  - easy to accidentally diverge
- We’d like a **single source of truth** in a repo,
  and a clean way to “deploy” them into `$HOME`.

## GNU Stow

**GNU Stow** is a symlink manager.

- You keep “real” files in a repo like:

```text
~/dotfiles/
  bash/.bashrc
  bash/.aliases
  git/.gitconfig
  ghostty/.config/ghostty/config
```

- Then you “stow” them into $HOME:
``` bash
cd ~/dotfiles
stow -t "$HOME" bash git ghostty
```

- stow creates symlinks:
``` bash
~/.bashrc  -> ~/dotfiles/bash/.bashrc
~/.gitconfig -> ~/dotfiles/git/.gitconfig
```

## Why Stow is nice for dotfiles

- Keeps `$HOME` clean → just symlinks
- Easy to enable/disable groups:
``` bash
stow -t "$HOME" bash
stow -D -t "$HOME" bash   # unstow
```

- Encourages a modular layout:
    - one folder per “package” (bash, git, ghostty, …)
- Works great with git:
    - version control your dotfiles repo
    - clone + stow on any machine
