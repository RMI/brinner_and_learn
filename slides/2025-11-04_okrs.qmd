## 🏎️ Will it make the car go faster?

- Red Bull's Formula 1 Racing team asks one question before every decision:  
- **“Will it make the car go faster?”**

- If the answer is no, it’s **not a priority**.  
- Everyone from the pit crew to the strategist knows the same goal.

- For RMI, that question might be more like:  
- **“Will it drive decarbonization?”**

- This question helps us focus our energy and creativity on work that accelerates impact — the equivalent of making our car go faster.

## 🎯 Why are we talking about OKRs?

**Objectives** and **Key Results** help bridge our day-to-day work with SPD’s broader mission:

 - *Enabling public and private sector actors to make energy transition decisions using SPD products.*

- They:
  - Define what to prioritize and (often more crucially) **what not to**.  
  - Help every team member align on outcomes that *move the needle*.  
  - Connect organization, team, and personal objectives to measurable outcomes.

## ⚙️ OKR Fundamentals

Good OKRs always focus on **outcomes** and not activities.

- **Objective:** What we want to achieve 
- **Key Results:** How we’ll measure success 
- Each KR must be measurable and collectively signal achievement of the Objective.

---

## 🧩 Anatomy of a Good OKR

- Example Objective:  
  - *Ensure every SPD product delivers impact and engagement, not just technical completion.*

- Key Results:
  - All new project concepts validated with real users (0–1.0)  
  - All new project proposals budgeted for comms & design (0–1.0)  
  - All product launches include a “splash” marketing moment (0–1.0)  
  - Collaboration process defined with Influence team (0–1.0)

---

## 🧮 Stretch and Grade

If you always hit 100%, your goals aren’t ambitious enough.

- Key Results shouldn’t be binary “done/not done.”  
- We use a **0–1.0 scale** to track progress.  
- **~0.7** indicates we’re at the right level of stretch — ambitious but achievable.  
- OKRs are designed to **push learning**, not **punish shortfalls**.

---

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls

- OKRs should be:
  - Few in number  
  - Measurable  
  - Focused on **value**, not **activity**  

- Avoid:
  - Confusing outputs: 🚫 “deploy web application to production and publish blog post”)
  - with outcomes: ✅ "X% of pilot users log in more than twice within the first month”)
  - Setting too many OKRs — **focus is power**  
  - Writing vague or unmeasurable goals (“do more research”)  

---

## 🏗️ How SPD Uses OKRs

- We decide what’s most important each quarter  
- We measure progress toward outcomes, not outputs  
- We keep workload realistic to prevent burnout  
- We maintain alignment and velocity across the team

## 🧭 How Are OKRs Different From OOMs?

| Concept | Purpose |
|----------|----------|
| **OOMs** | Report organizational milestones & long-term yearly targets |
| **OKRs** | Ground each quarter in actionable, measurable goals that connect to daily work and sprint backlogs |
