# Brinner and Learn
A repository of "Brinner and Learn" presentations hosted by RMI's SPD team.

# Adding New Presentations
Presentations are saved as `.qmd` files, and rendered using `quarto`.

To submit a new presentation, please open a PR into this repository with a file named `YYYY-MM-DD_title_in_snake_case.qmd` in the `slides` directory. The file should contain the following metadata at the top:

``` qmd
---
title: "Title of Presentation"
author: "First Last"
---
```

See the [quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/) for more information.
